# Welcome to my portfolio !

My name is Bartosz and Iâ€™m a software engineer currently focusing on developing web applications.

## TL;DR

I started my career as a software engineer in 2014.
During this time I created lots of projects in many programming languages. 
First I've learned embedded C and C++. 
I created many programs on STM32 Microcontrollers and in Qt.
The biggest project was a line follower robot which was self-controlled by a PID algorithm or it could be controlled remotely by bluetooth.

Next I started learning high-level programming languages.
My first choice was Java. 
I've written a few desktop applications in JavaFX and then I started to learn web developing in Spring.

I had a short episode with PHP that time.

When I was learning Spring I started learning Python parallel. I created a Neutral Network with TensorFlow, and to create some apps on Raspberry PI. 
I've also built web apps in Flask.

Nowadays I focus on NodeJS, React and Kubernetes. 
It's given me a lot of satisfaction since 2019 and I want to stay longer with these technologies. 


| Check few of my projects below | |
| --- | --- |
|[Dice Game](https://github.com/Bartosz95/dice-game)| |
| Currently I develop this project in my spare time. It is a great game but it is also very well designed. Application includes GUI written in React and API written in ExpressJS. There is also an authorization service delivered by Keycloak. What is more, it uses two databases PostgreSQL and MongoDB with Mongo-Express. All components are deployed on Kubernetes. In my opinion it's definitely worth it to see if you want to check my skills. |<p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/dice-game/blob/master/gui/public/img/tom1.png"></p>|
|[Chatroom](https://github.com/Bartosz95/chat-room)| |
|The project contains a website which allows communication between users in real time. It is based on NodeJS with the Handlebars module. Main functionality uses  WebSockets. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/chat-room/blob/master/doc/chat3.png"></p> |
|[Traffic Sign Recognition System](https://github.com/Bartosz95/traffic-sign-recognition)| |
|Systems like that help drivers while riding in a car. In this project I created one of my own and tried to improve him. This war was more focusing on exploration and investigation of how to find the best setup. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/traffic-sign-recognition/blob/master/doc/img/27center.jpg"></p> |
|[Air Parameters Monitoring System](https://github.com/Bartosz95/air-parameters-monitoring)| |
|The basic assumption for the project was to inform the residents about the current air condition in the room. The information should include three parameters,temperature, humidity, pressure The values are collected and can be displayed by User Interface in real time. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/air-parameters-monitoring/blob/master/doc/graphs2.png"></p> |
|[House Interior Monitoring System](https://github.com/Bartosz95/house-interior-monitor)| | |
|This project allows you to monitor your house interior. It checks your air parameters like temperature, humidity and pressure and records the rooms with cameras. Data is collected in a database and is displayed for users on the browser. System consists of one server which gives you access to data and at least one sensor which collects data. It was written in 2017. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/house-interior-monitor/blob/master/doc/rec.PNG"></p> |
|[Medical Clinics Mananger](https://github.com/Bartosz95/medical-clinics-mananger) | |
|It is a great application to manage medical clinics. The biggest advantage of this application is the fact that it uses two databases which can be deployed in different localizacion. Some tables are split horizontally and some vertically. See project to read more about distributed databases. Of course there is a desktop application written in JavaFX. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/medical-clinics-mananger/blob/master/doc/3.png" ></p>|
|[KidnApp - Android App](https://github.com/Bartosz95/KidnApp)||
KidnApp can help you be more safe. When you are in danger you can press both the volume up and volume down buttons for eight seconds and it starts sending SMS with your localization and text message to your contacts every three minutes. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/KidnApp/blob/master/Description/photo/menu.png" WIDTH="180px;"></p> |
|[Linefollowers](https://github.com/Bartosz95/linefollowers)| |
|Linefollower is a mobile robot which follows the line. My robots were built for competitions so the main aim was to allow them to move fast. Some of them were also remote controlled. I've created these robots from top to bottom by myself. It means that I designed a board, created it, soldered elements, created a program for CPU and installed it. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/linefollowers/blob/master/doc/front.jpg"></p> |
|[Memo Game](https://github.com/Bartosz95/memo-game)| |
| This is a simple memo game also written in JavaFX. It is quite easy but I wrote it just for fun. | <p align="center"><p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Bartosz95/memo-game/blob/master/description-images/game.PNG" width="230px;"></p> |
