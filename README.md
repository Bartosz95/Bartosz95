# Welcome to my smithy ! 

<p align="center"><img src="./smithy.png" width="200px;"></p>

My name is Bartosz Lenartowicz and Iâ€™m a software developer currently focusing on web app.

## TL;DR

I started my journey from Embedded Programming. 
First I created my programs in C and then in C++. 
That time I also created line follower robots. 

Next I started learning Java. I've written a few projects in it, some of them were written in JavaFX and some of Spring. That time I structurise my preference for programming and I decided to be a web developer.

I also have short episot with PHP but we don't like each other.

Nowadays I work with NodeJS, React and Kubernetes and it gives me a lot of satisfaction.
